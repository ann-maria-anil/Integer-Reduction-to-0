The "Integer Reduction to 0" program is designed to take a positive integer as input and systematically reduce it to zero following a specified set of rules. 
This program is implemented in Python and provides a clear and interactive way for users to explore the process of reducing a given integer to zero through a series of operations.
If it is an even number the number is divided by 2 else it is subtracted
